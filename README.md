## Introduction

This repository is part of a series on system design concepts, focusing on the journey of scaling applications from **0 users** to **1 million users**. It covers various key concepts such as:

- Sharding
- Horizontal and vertical scaling
- Load balancing
- Caching
- Messaging queues

## Steps for Scaling

### 1. Single Server

- **Basic Setup**: Start with a single server for the application, database, and client.
- **Usage**: This setup is suitable for the initial stage with zero users.

### 2. Application and Database Separation

- **Separation of Concerns**: Introduce a separate layer for the application server to handle business logic while the database server manages data storage and retrieval.
- **Benefits**: This separation enables independent scaling of both the application and the database.

### 3. Load Balancing and Multiple Application Servers

- **Load Balancer**: Implement a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple application servers.
- **Benefits**: Ensures efficient handling of increased traffic, providing security and privacy while distributing workload.

### 4. Database Replication

- **Master-Slave Configuration**: Set up a master-slave database configuration where the master database handles write operations, and slave databases manage read operations.
- **Performance Improvement**: This approach improves performance and provides redundancy in case of database failure.

### 5. Caching

- **Caching Layer**: Utilize a caching layer to store frequently accessed data in memory.
- **Efficiency**: The application server checks the cache before accessing the database, reducing the load on the database and improving response time. Implement time-to-live (TTL) to manage cached data expiry.

### 6. Content Delivery Network (CDN)

- **Distributed Network**: Use a CDN to cache static content closer to users, reducing latency and improving website performance globally.
- **Handling Requests**: The CDN handles requests for static content (images, videos, JavaScript files) and, in case of a cache miss, queries neighboring CDNs before reaching the origin database.

### 7. Multiple Data Centers

- **Geographic Distribution**: Distribute the application and database across multiple data centers to reduce load on individual centers and enhance reliability.
- **User Access**: This setup enables geographically distributed user access with minimal latency, with the load balancer directing requests based on user location.

### 8. Messaging Queues

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Implement messaging queues to handle asynchronous tasks, like sending notifications or emails.
- **Decoupling Tasks**: This method decouples tasks from the main application flow, improving performance and reliability by managing high-volume tasks efficiently with platforms like RabbitMQ or Kafka.

### 9. Database Scaling

- **Vertical Scaling**: Increase the capacity of existing database servers (CPU, RAM). Note that this approach has limitations and eventually reaches a ceiling.
- **Horizontal Scaling / Data Sharding**: Split the database across multiple servers or shards, distributing data based on a specific key. This method offers better scalability through:
  - **Vertical Sharding**: Splitting columns of a database.
  - **Horizontal Sharding**: Splitting rows of a database.

## Conclusion

Scaling your application from zero to a million users requires careful planning and implementation of various concepts like load balancing, caching, and database sharding. Each step is crucial in ensuring your system remains efficient and reliable as user demand grows.
